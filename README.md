## Serverless image classification with functions & TensorFlow

Demonstrates a serverless function capable of simple image classification using TensorFlow

Throw random images at your function and expecting it to (hopefully) return something sane !
Just like this image (of what looks like a pizza) when passed on to our classification function returns -  `This is a 'pizza' Accuracy - 96%`
